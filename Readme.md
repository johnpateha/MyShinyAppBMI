Project description

The body mass index (BMI) is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, 
and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. 

BMI is commonly employed among children and adults to predict health outcomes. 
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30.
